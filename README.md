# Ebook 

The aim is to create a python app for renting ebooks.

## Thing I found out about pyodbc along the way 

### List out the tables

```python
varibale_name = list(coursor.tables())
```

- This will print out a list of tables 
- Where they are stored and there names 
- Will not print out info in the table
